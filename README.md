☀️ Helios Bot Website

A premium, single-page portfolio website for the "Helios" Discord Bot, featuring a unique hand-drawn "sketchy" aesthetic, high-performance 3D animations, and an embedded mini-game.

🎨 Overview

This project is a fully responsive, Single Page Application (SPA) designed to showcase the features of Helios, an all-in-one Discord bot. Unlike standard clean corporate sites, this project embraces a "Sketchy/Doodle" design language, utilizing hand-drawn fonts, jittery borders, and paper textures to create a unique user experience.

Despite the playful look, the site is powered by heavy-duty frontend animation libraries to ensure a premium, smooth feel.
